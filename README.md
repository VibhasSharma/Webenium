⚙️ Features
Cross-Browser Testing: Run automated tests across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
Parallel Test Execution: Execute tests in parallel using frameworks like TestNG or JUnit to reduce execution time.
Data-Driven Testing: Support for running tests with different datasets using Excel, CSV, or databases.
Page Object Model (POM): The Page Object Model design pattern is used to keep tests clean and maintainable.
Screenshots: Automatically capture screenshots upon test failure for easy debugging.
Reporting: Generate detailed reports for test execution using frameworks like TestNG, Allure, or ExtentReports.
Continuous Integration (CI): Integration with CI tools like Jenkins for automated test execution in the pipeline.
📥 Installation
To use this Selenium automation framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/selenium-automation.git
cd selenium-automation
2. Install Required Dependencies
Make sure you have Java installed on your system. This project uses Maven to manage dependencies.

bash
Copy
mvn clean install
Alternatively, if you're using Gradle, run:

bash
Copy
gradle build
3. Set Up Your WebDriver
To run Selenium tests, download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser and ensure it's accessible in your system’s PATH.

Chrome: ChromeDriver
Firefox: GeckoDriver
Edge: EdgeDriver
🔧 Prerequisites
Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

Java (version 8 or higher)
Maven (or Gradle if using)
WebDriver for your preferred browser
IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode for running and editing tests
🚀 Usage
Run Tests Locally: Run your tests via the terminal or your IDE using Maven or Gradle.

Maven:

bash
Copy
mvn test
Gradle:

bash
Copy
gradle test
Run Tests on Specific Browser: To specify the browser, configure the browser variable in the config.properties file or pass it as a system property when running tests.

Example:

bash
Copy
mvn clean test -Dbrowser=chrome
Running Parallel Tests: Modify the test configuration to run in parallel for faster execution using TestNG or JUnit.

For TestNG:

Configure the testng.xml file to set the desired parallelism.
Viewing Reports: After the tests have run, you can find the generated reports in the target/test-classes or build/reports directory, depending on your build tool.
